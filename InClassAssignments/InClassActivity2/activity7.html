    <h1>This is my idea: </h1>
    <p>When we design the website, we should put different tabs for teachers and students. I recommend to use JavaScript to do the website becuase if we only use html there are a few functions we cannot use. and also, if we use JavaScript the website will
        look better. we should use follow things(tags) to manage this website: section, class, tabs, hr and etc..
    </p>
    <p>We also need CSS file to manage the sytle of the website, beucase using CSS to manage style is much easier and much cleaner.</p>
    <p>font, size, color and other componenets should be regulated becuase if each page's layout and format is different.</p>
    <p>It will be very hard to read, and looks unprofessornal.</p>
